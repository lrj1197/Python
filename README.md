# Python
Here we explore the ways of solving math and physics problems/equations with python and its many packages. Some of the codes posted include how to plot basic functions, how to do some basic arithmatic and use python as a calculator. Also some more advanced matrial like how to solve ordinary differential equations and plot their solutions, and making simutations of a double pendulum.
